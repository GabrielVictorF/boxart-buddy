TOKUMEINO-GRADIENTS
These templates were contributed by @Tokumeino and can be found standalone
with scripts to generate artwork without using Boxart Buddy here:

https://github.com/gerpy/muos-artwork

This template comes with lots of variants, and lots of different masks
so the Makefile doesn't have every possible combination of them

You can look at some of the permutations and modify the commands to pick a different artwork & mask combination
